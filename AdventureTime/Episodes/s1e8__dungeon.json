  "synopsis": "Finn descends into a dungeon in hopes of finding adventure, but ultimately finding various obstacles that better fit being handled by Jake than himself alone.",
  "plot": "Finn and Jake are first seen being deposited on a mountain top by a swan driven by Princess Bubblegum. The princess instructs them to put up warning signs around a well that holds an entrance to a dungeon, then departs on princess business. After the heroes finish putting up the signs and Jake prepares for lunch, he tells Finn a story about the Crystal Eye hidden inside the dungeon. Finn, filled with excitement, prepares to enter the well, but Jake taunts him about being useless without him. Finn bets that he can get through the dungeon alone and jumps in the well, leaving Jake to finish his lunch.\n\nInside, Finn happily traverses through rooms containing monsters, traps, and chests. Eventually, he runs into the Demon Cat who attacks and cuts up his shirt. The cat, however, runs off upon smelling Jake's dog scent on Finn. Miffed that his friend is still somewhat helping him, the boy carries on. Coming up to a locked door, Finn tries to imitate Jake's Key Hand but has no luck. He notices the key through a small tunnel, but discovers it is inside a green jelly cube. Being unable to get the key, Finn tries to keep upbeat but falls through the floor into a waterfall cavern. There, he is confronted by the Bucket Knight, whom Finn taunts before moving ahead. The knight, however, pours water on himself to swell him and he chases Finn. The two battle slightly but Finn escapes.\n\nIn the next area, Finn runs into the Demon Cat again, who overheard Finn stating Jake is not here. The boy hides behind stalagmites while the Demon Cat attempts to locate him. Hearing this, Finn is frightened that if he is caught, he should be eaten. When it seems Finn is doomed, a glowing woman with wings and a white dress appears in front of Finn, claiming to be his Guardian Angel. She carries Finn away into the dungeon and heals him completely of his wounds and scratches as well as repairing his clothes. As Finn is lured into feeling secure, she reveals she will eat him and shows her disfigured face. She drops him into a cage filled with green broth, bones, and vegetables before lighting a fire beneath it. Deflated, Finn admits he needs Jake. Jake is then revealed to be in the cage too. As the friends reunite, Jake explains how he went into the dungeon looking for Finn, but kept running into frustrating challenges that Finn could easily overcome. With new found respect, the two break out of the cage and send it falling onto the Guardian Angel.\n\nPlanning on completing Finn's bet, the heroes proceed to the chamber of the Crystal Eye, revealed to be a big diamond-like gem. Upon lifting it, they inadvertently unleash Eye Demons that attack them. Both are unable to defeat them, and it seems they shall be killed. Princess Bubblegum then appears, destroying demons with her Swan's laser ability. With the three safely on the swan, the demons are chased back under the Crystal Eye, which is placed back over them. However, Princess Bubblegum berates Finn, while the two accept they learned their lesson: they are better as a team. Princess Bubblegum is not happy with their answer, but accepts Finn's hasty answer that she is an intelligent princess. The episode ends with the three blasting a hole out of the dungeon and flying away on the swan.",

  "transcriptText": "Princess Bubblegum: [to Finn and Jake] Alright, guys. Hammer all these safety signs around this dungeon hole. I've gotta jet off on my swan to take care of some royal junk.\nFinn: You got it, Princess.\nJake: Whatever you want, mama.\nPrincess Bubblegum: Bubblegum, away!!\n[Finn nails a sign with a sledgehammer, and Jake uses his fists as hammers]\nJake: Ow. Ow. Ow.\nFinn: There. That's the last sign, Jake. Now no one will go down this hole, ever. Probably a lot of dangerous, awesome stuff down this hole. I better go take a look.\n[Finn jumps down the hole, and Jake fishes him out using his arm as a fishing pole and line]\nJake: Don't, dude. For you see, that's the secret entrance to the Dungeon of the Crystal Eye!\nFinn: Whoa.\nJake: Legend has it that the eye rests in the deepest chamber of this accursed dungeon. Man, we shouldn't even be talkin' about it, 'cause it's lunch time. [holds out picnic equipment]\n[A \"LUNCH TIME\" logo pops up]\nFinn: The crystal eye. I wanna meet this dungeon.\nJake: Maybe after lunch.\nFinn: Eh, I'll skip lunch. Just catch up with me when you are finished.\nJake: *Pfft* Yeah, right.\nFinn: What?\nJake: Without the aid of my magnificent powers... [shapes hand into bottle opener and opens a bottle of water] ...Huh? Huh? You'd get killed down there.\nFinn: Hey! I can do things without you! You wanna bet I can't?\nJake: Nope. Come get your sandwich. [using Finn's sandwich as a puppet] Listen to Jake, Finn. He only wants what's best for--[Jake bites Finn's sandwich] [using sandwich puppet, muffled] Ahh! Help me! Ahh! Come put her out of her misery, dude!\nFinn: We are betting! I bet that I'll get that crystal eye and be back within 11 minutes. [quickly] Ready set go! [jumps down hole]\nJake: [sighs] I better go after him.\nJake [as sandwich puppet]: No, Jake! Stay here, with me...\nJake: Oh, my... [makes out with the sandwich]\n[scene switches to inside the dungeon.]\nFinn: Dungeons! Chambers! Woah. [Sees bugbears everywhere] Evil creatures! [laughs as monsters chase him] Treasure chests! [treasure chest is actually a mimic monster, Finn laughs, jumps away as the creature tries to punch him, then the creature vomits gold, coins, doubloons, and rings and rubies]\nFinn: Doorways! [floorboards try to close on him] Traps! [Long jumps out of trap] I'm in my elemeeeeeeeeent!! [Lands in chamber, sees a kitten's head sticking out of a black cave entrance]\nFinn: Aww!\n[cat head turns upside down and ominously meows]\nFinn: [freaked out] Oh?\n[A demonic cat with a kitten for a tongue comes out, and sucks his tongue back in his mouth]\nFinn: Whoa! Somebody come pick up your freaky cat.\nDemon Cat: Greetings, Frank the Human Boy.\nFinn: How did you almost know my name?!\nDemon Cat: I have approximate knowledge of many things. For instance, I know that I am possibly going to slay you and munch on your eyeballs. [circles Finn]\nFinn: Huh, yeah right. That sounds like idiot talk!\nDemon Cat: You're trespassing on my dungeon, manling. And I am the thing... [brandishes claws] ...you should be afraid of.\nFinn: You can't hurt me! I'm a radical boy on a mission for the crystal eye!\nDemon Cat: I'm going to unzip your skin and wear you like a little coat.\nFinn: Unzip this! [Does an armpit-fart, jumps back]\n[the Demon Cat leaps at him]\nFinn: Bleep! [Demon Cat holds him down, and fiendishly bites at him] OOF!\n[Finn punches him, the Demon Cat's eyes fill up with blood]\nDemon Cat: Now, you DIE!! [Leaps at Finn, and tears up his clothes, then stops]\nDemon Cat: Wait a minute. [Sniffs twice] Is that dog smell?! You... you have a dog with you? I'm outta here! [Runs away]\nFinn: Yeah, right! Good excuse! Slaps, that cat was kicking my buns! And it might have finished my buns if it weren't for Jake's stank. Dang it, Jake! I'll get that crystal eye on my own! With my own odors. [walks by 3 different doors] Hmm, no to skeletal remains door. [Sees a door that is a monsters mouth, Finn kicks in a skeleton and a trap closes on it] No to giant monster mouth door. [sees key door] Oh! Giant key door it is!\n[Tries to open, but it's locked]\nFinn: If Jake was here, he could stretch his hand into a key and open it. [shapes his hand like a key] Yeah! Key hand! [tries to open the door, but bruises his hand] Ouch! [notices a green glow coming from a hatch] Hey! What the jug is that?\n[Crawls in]\nFinn: Oh, sweet, the key!\n[Finn sings the Key Song]\n[Reaches for key, which is inside a gelatinous green jelly cube]\nFinn: Ew, jelly cube?! [Tries to get the key but almost gets sucked in] Come on! Give it to me! Don't flaunt it if you're not gonna give it up! [Screaming, falls out of the cube] I'll never get that crystal eye! No. No, I just gotta stay pumped. [starts dancing, and singing] Pump it up, pump it up! Whoo! Whoo! Shake it! Shake it! Ahh! [Falls through the floor, lands in a waterfall chamber] Steady, Finn. This place is probably more creeped out of you than you are of it. [Jumps onto the floor]\nBucket Knight: Halt! Come no further adventurer, for you see none can defeat... the Bucket Knight! [He appears to be very small]\nFinn: Okay, then I won't fight you.\nBucket Knight: No! You must challenge me to-- [Finn interrupts him]\nFinn: Hey cutie, do you know how to get to the crystal eye from here?\nBucket Knight: Yes, it's through that door over there, but-- [Finn runs past him]\nFinn: Thanks!\nBucket Knight: Hey! You can't pass through that door with out battling me!\nFinn: Yes, I can. Because I'm huge compared to you.\nBucket Knight: [to himself] Just add water and... [Pours water on himself] ...exponential growth!\nFinn: Aw, buckets.\nBucket Knight: Now, activate thine own powers, and we shall engage in thrilling single combat!\nFinn: [nervously] Heh, thing is... I don't really... have any powers.\nBucket Knight: [smiles] I see...\n[Gets chased by Bucket Knight]\nFinn: AAAAH!! Dang it, Jake wouldn't be running! He'd grow all big, and sock you right in the nose hole! [Bucket Knight kicks the gorund, which it's vibration sends Finn flying] Aw, nutzoids! [tries to run away, but Bucket Knight slides on the ground, causing Finn to once again, go flying] Come on! All aboard the knuckle train to fist planet! [jumps up, but Bucket Knight punches him far, bruising him really badly]\nFinn: Oww... I rode the knuckle train? But... I... I'm in my element.\n[Runs away and finally gets to the door, but the Bucket Knight is right behind him. Before he could hit Finn, Finn jumps through the door]\nFinn: AHHHHH!!!! Ow! OW! Ow! OW! Ow! Uhh! That... sucked. [Takes a deep breath] Alright, Finn, you're in a heavy pickle here. You don't have Jake, and you're on your own. But you can still handle this. You can still get that crystal eye! [The Demon Cat is awake and crawls on a ledge an sees Finn]\nDemon Cat: Hey, my dinner is back. And your dog isn't with you! That's what you said, right? Jack the Dog is not \"accompanying\" you?\nFinn: You mean Jake?\nDemon Cat: Jake, Jack, whatever. He's not here, which means I'm going to rip your heart out. [Chases Finn]\nFinn: Crud, crud, crud, crud, crud!\nDemon Cat: You can't hide from me, Jim. I know almost everything, remember? I know exactly where you might be, Jim. I'm about to pounce on you.\n[Finn sits behind a rock pillar, nervous and scared]\nDemon Cat: One... two... three! [jumps behind a rock] Aw, man! I thought you'd be behind this rock. Hmm... [sniffs twice] Alright. I know where you are now! And I'm about to pounce again! [Finn gets more scared] One... two... three! [jumps behind another rock] Aw, man! Well, there's only a few more places to look.\nFinn: Oh, Jake... I'm such a fool. A silly, silly fool. [a hand touches his mouth] Who the heck--?!\nGuardian Angel: Hey, it's okay. Shh, I'm your guardian angel, Finn. I'm here to save you.\nFinn: Re...really?\nGuardian Angel: Mmm-hm. Come here, let the angel pick you up.\nFinn: Okay. [Flies away with the angel, laughs] This is radical.\nGuardian Angel: Are you comfortable? Would you like some snacks?\nFinn: I'm fine, thank you.\nGuardian Angel: Here, let me clean you up, and mend your clothes. [Casts healing magic to clean up Finn and fix his clothes]\nFinn: Ha ha ha ha ha!\nGuardian Angel: I'm taking you to the chamber of the Crystal Eye....\nFinn: Aww, yeah!\nGuardian Angel: ... where I'm going to cook you and eat your flesh.\nFinn: Wow... Wait! What??!\nGuardian Angel: Trust in your [The \"angel\" shows her true colors as her face misshapens into a hideous form, and a raspy voice] guardian angel!\nFinn: Put me down, lady!\nGuardian Angel: As you wish.\n[Drops Finn in a cage full of soup and ingredients]\nFinn: Man, everybody wants to eat me up. It's probably 'cause I'm so sweet.\nGuardian Angel: Now for little kid soup. [Lights a fire] The secret is a low flame over a long period.\nFinn: That's Jake's secret, too. I sure hope he saves me.\nGuardian Angel: [Flies away with beautiful face] I will save thee, Finn.\nFinn: Lady, you are sick! Oh, Jake.\nJake: What?\nFinn: Jake!\nJake: Finn!\nFinn: What are you doing here?!\nJake: I was looking for you, knucklehead! I was so worried, that right after lunch, I plunged into the dungeon after you.\nJake: Strangest thing, though, I kept runnin' into obstacles.\n[Flashback begins]\nReaper: Choose your dueling weapon!\nJake: Uh... I choose... sandwich! [He grabs his sandwich and fights with the reaper who simply cuts through it with a sword]\nJake: [voiceover] The challenges were impossible for me.\n[Goblin King challenges Jake to spitting their spit the farthest and laughs when Jake throws a pathetic spit]\n[A monster makes Jake chase a laser pointer, which leads Jake to bump into a wall]\nJake: [voiceover] But you would have blown right through. I kept thinking to myself, \"What would Finn do?\" Just...eh, frustrating. Know what I mean?\nFinn: Yeah... I think I do. [Both chuckle, there's a moment of silence]\n[A \"NEWFOUND RESPECT\" logo pops up as they awkwardly handshake]\nFinn: Now let's find a way out of this cage.\nJake: I'll get us out with Key Hand! [forms a Key Hand]\nFinn: I really don't see any key holes on this cage.\nJake: Not a problem, man. Lock Hand!\nFinn: [laughs] I'll get us out of here, with carrot hand!\n[takes a carrot and lights it on fire, and gives it to Jake. Jake sets the cage's rope on fire, and it drops on the Guardian Angel, killing her]\nJake: Alright, man. Let's go! We've still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet!\nFinn: Wait! You'd help me win a bet that I made that I said I could accomplish something without you?\nJake: Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy!\nFinn: Cling!\n[Finn laughs, and Jake carries him to the chamber of the crystal eye]\nJake: Alright, man. Let's give this crystal eye the old friendship lift.\nFinn: Okay.\nBoth: Friendship, go!\n[Demonic Eye Creatures fly out and Finn and Jake try to kill them, but they melt their weapons]\nFinn: If I die, I'll have died with my best friend!\nJake: Me, too!\n[Princess Bubblegum flies in on her swan, angry]\nPrincess Bubblegum: Get on my swan!\n[Finn and Jake hop on her swan, which kills all the eye creatures with laser eyes]\nPrincess Bubblegum: I hope you learned a lesson from all this!\nBoth: Uh, we learned that working together is better. Heh, whatever.\n[Princess Bubblegum growls]\nJake: [whispers to Finn] Looks like that's not the answer she wanted.\nFinn: Uhh... I learned that you're a very... intelligent princess?\nPrincess Bubblegum: You're darn right I am. Princess Bubblegum, away!!\n[The three break out of the dungeon riding the swan. \"ADVENTURE TIME\" logo pops up just as the episode ends.]"
